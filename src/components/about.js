        <h4>
          UX/UI Designer <span>&</span> Developer

          from Orlando Florida.
        </h4>

        <p>
          I create minimal websites and applications that are easy to use by
          focusing on the content, respecting margins, and adding subtle
          interactions that engage the user.
        </p>

        <p>
          My passion for design sparked when I was approaching graduation at
          Florida Atlantic University. After receiving my degree, I decided to
          pursue my passion by joining Blocâ€™s Designer Track. Then I landed an
          internship at Apple as a UX/UI Designer working on internal websites
          and platforms. I've recently starting working with React (this site is
          my first project{" "}
          <span role="img" aria-label="grinning face with squinting eyes">
            ðŸ˜„
          </span>
          ) and knowing front-end development has made me a stronger designer.

          <em>Fun facts:</em> I'm a sucker for great branding (almost bought a
          brand of almond milk just because of it), cookies & cream flavored
          anything, and craft beer.

          Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to impact multiple areas of Apple Retail
          during my six years here while working across three different stores.
          I started in sales, then moved to operations, and now I currently work
          at the Genius Bar as a Technical Expert. My current role involves
          troubleshooting hardware and software, repairing devices, and training
          new hires.
