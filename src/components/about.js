        <p>
          I create minimal websites and applications that are easy to use by
          focusing on the content, respecting margins, and adding subtle
          interactions that engage the user.

        <p>
          My passion for design sparked when I was coming up to my graduation at
          Florida Atlantic University. After getting my degree, I decided to
          pursue my passion by joining Blocâ€™s Designer Track. Then I landed an
          internship at Apple as a UX/UI Designer. I've recently starting
          working with React (this site is my first project{" "}
          <span role="img" aria-label="grinning face with squinting eyes">
            ðŸ˜„
          </span>
          ) and knowing front-end development has made me a stronger designer.

          <em>Fun facts:</em> I'm a sucker for great branding (almost bought a
          brand of almond milk just because of it), cookies & cream flavored
          anything, and craft beer.
